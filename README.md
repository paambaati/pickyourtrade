# PickYourTrade
A portfolio tracker built on Node, Vue &amp; SQLite3.

// TODO: screencast GIF with Gifox.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Quick-Start

Just paste these into your terminal console.

1. `git clone git@github.com:paambaati/pickyourtrade.git`
2. `cd pickyourtrade/app && npm install && npm run serve`
3. In a new window, `cd pickyourtrade/server && npm install && npm run debug`
4. Open [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in your browser!

### Running Tests

1. `cd pickyourtrade/app && npm test`
2. `cd pickyourtrade/server && npm test`

### Developer Notes

Note that the tests are not extensive. The current test suite covers all aspects of testing a Vue app, so it can be used as boilerplate to finish up the rest.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Technology Choices

### Why Node.js?

1. Fully non-blocking & asynchronous.
2. Not a CPU-intensive workload.
3. Easy of use and wealth of community packages (for example, we use [Koa](https://koajs.com/) for the core API server).
4. Same language as the frontend!

### Why SQLite3?

1. Embeddable, so portable and no additional setup.
2. Very fast and capable <sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup><sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> for simple workloads (all the app uses is `SELECT` &amp; `INSERT`).
3. Has an in-memory mode too, which is _much_ faster than disk-backed mode.
4. The database size is relative small (//TODO: extrapolate some numbers here).

## üìà Scale

The current version of the app is built on Node.js for the backend API, and uses SQLite3 for the database.

### Benchmarks

// TODO: run benchmarks and paste numbers here - perhaps looks at https://k6.io/ or vegeta.

These numbers show that the current version of the app can easily scale to 1000 concurrent users.

### Scaling Beyond 1k Users

Before we scale-up this solution, we'll need some numbers around usage characteristics ‚Äî

1. Is the app read-heavy or write-heavy?
2. Do the read and write times deteriorate over time with more users onboarded? If yes, by how much? This is where baseline and periodic performance metrics help.
3. What is the average size of a single row of data? What is the average size of a user's portfolio (`average row size * no. tickers average user has`)?

With these numbers in place, we can then try to find performance bottlenecks. Possible bottlenecks are ‚Äî

| **Bottleneck** | **Causes** | **Solutions** |  |  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| Slow DB read/writes. | 1. Slow disk. 2. Low free RAM (only in memory mode). | 1. Upgrade to SSD/NVMe/IOPS-optimized storage. 2. Upgrade RAM.|  |  |
| Too many open HTTP connections. | 1. Long-running connections. 2. Too few open handles. | 1. Identify root cause for long-running connections and fix them. 2. Fine-tune `sysctl`. |  |  |
| Memory leaks | 1. Too many global variables. 2. Very big closures that cannot be GC'ed fast enough. 3. Unbound collections that can grow unchecked. | 1. Avoid global variables. 2. Use closures sparingly. 3. Always set upper bounds for any collection data structure. |  |  |

üö© Note that some of these are specific to Node.js.

#### Horizontal Scaling & Choice of Database

Note that most of the solutions discussed above are to vertically scale the app. In most cases however, the database is the biggest bottleneck of any app. As the app's userbase scales rapidly, it might be considering a **distributed** database. Based on the app usage metrics and our performance baseline metrics, an appropriate database can be chosen to replace SQLite; any database that can provide easy replication would let us horizontally scale.

üì£ A _personal_ recommendation would be [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/) ‚Äî it is built from the ground-up for the real-time web (especially great for streaming data), and so would be a great match to build more features like a live updating ticker<sup id="a3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>. It has sharding/replication, fantastic documentation, a very well thought-out admin UI and a fun query language<sup id="a4">[[4]](#f4)</sup> that feels great to use in JS-land.
